Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Saurav

Programming is my profession as well as my hobby, and this profile is has projects that I have created in my free time or has piqued my interest. Some of them are related to - or build off - each other, but most of them are completely unrelated and represent whatever I thought it would be fun to work on at the time.
